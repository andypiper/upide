It's meant to make working with Micropython as easy as possible.
All the work is done on the target device and python files can
be created, edited, run etc from with the IDE.

## Status

µPIDE is still under development but does 95% of the job just fine.
It has been tested with the ESP32, ESP8266, PyBoard V1.1, Lego Spike
and the ftDuino32.

A single-exe binary for windows can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/harbaum/upide/releases/latest).

The since V1.0-beta4 µPIDE includes a flasher for the ESP32 and
ESP8266 boards. Tegether with the included firmware images getting
started doesn't require any other software.
