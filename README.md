It's meant to make working with Micropython as easy as possible.
All the work is done on the target device and python files can
be created, edited, run etc from with the IDE.

## Status

µPIDE is still under development but does 95% of the job just fine.
It has been tested with the ESP32, the Lego Spike and the ftDuino32.

A single-exe binary for windows can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/harbaum/upide/releases/latest).

## Planned features

- Ability to flash the micropython firmware (at least for ESP32)
- File import and export
- Built-in demos and examples
- ...
