<h1>Getting started with &mu;PIDE</h1>

<p>&mu;PIDE is meant to make working with MicroPython based devices as
  simple as possible. This help page is meant to guide you through the
  first steps.</p>

<p>All data is stored on your MicroPython device. &mu;PIDE allows you to
  create, edit and run Python programs directly on your device.</p>

<h2>The file view</h2>

<p>The file view area on the left shows you everything that is stored on
  your MicroPython device. These may be Python files (ending with .py)
  and other files. &mu;PIDE mainly allows you to work with the Python
  files. The files on the device may be organized in directories.</p>

<p>You can double click on any existing file in the file view. If &mu;PIDE
  supports editing the file type then a editor view will open to allow
  you to work on that file.</p>

<p>You can also right click on any item in the file view. This will open
  a context menu that allows you to create new files, delete existing files,
  import and export files from and to your PC etc.</p>

<h2>The editor</h2>

<p>If you open an existing file are create a new one, a editor window will
  open. This allows you to modify the file as you like. Two icons will
  appear in the lower right corner of your editor window: A black "save"
  icon and a green "run" icon.</p>

<p>Hitting the "run" button will download your code onto the target
  device and run it. This doesn't mean that the modified data is also
  saved in the target. Modifying a file in the editor and running it
  will not overwrite anything on the device and the modified file is
  not stored.</p>

<p>The program will use the console are at the bottom of &mu;PIDEs main
  window to print text or to allow the user to input data. Also
  error messages will appear there.</p>

<p>Writing modified data back to the device is done using the "save"
  button. Pressing it will store your changes on the device possibly
  overwriting any previous version. Your change will thus be preserved
  and previous file contents will be replaced.</p>

<p>Save your work frequently, otherwise it may be lost if you e.g.
  unplug the device from the computer before saving.</p>

<h2>The REPL console</h2>

<p>One of the big advantages of Python is its ability for interactive
  usage. The REPL console at the bottom of the &mu;PIDE window is used
  for this.</p>

<p><img src="assets/console_prompt.svg"/></p>

<p>Hit the black prompt button in the console area to enter
  REPL mode (REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print and Loop)
  and to interact directly with the device.</p>
